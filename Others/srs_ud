Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for Online Grievance Redressal Portal Project

1. Introduction:
1.1 Purpose:

The purpose of this document is to outline the software requirements for the development of an Online Grievance Redressal Portal, specifying the technologies for
both the front-end and back-end components.
1.2 Scope:

The online portal will be a web-based application developed with HTML5, CSS3, JS, BootStrap 5 for the front-end, and Java with SpringBoot, Hibernate, JPA for the 
back-end, and MySQL as the database.
2. Functional Requirements:

2.1 User Module (Front-end):

User Registration and Authentication:

Users should be able to register and log in securely using HTML5 forms and ReactJS components.
Grievance Submission:

A user-friendly form using HTML5 and ReactJS for submitting grievances with attachment support.
Real-time Tracking:

ReactJS components to provide real-time tracking of grievance status with updates and notifications.
User Profile Management:

ReactJS forms for users to manage their profiles.
2.2 Administration Module (Back-end):

Dashboard:
A SpringBoot service to provide administrators with a dashboard for an overview of the grievance resolution process.
Grievance Categorization and Prioritization:
Java and SpringBoot functions for categorizing and prioritizing grievances based on severity and nature.
Communication Hub:
Implement an integrated messaging system using SpringBoot for communication between citizens and authorities.
Data Analytics and Reporting:
Develop Java-based tools for administrators to analyze trends, monitor performance, and generate reports.
User Management:
Implement Java and SpringBoot functions for administrative control over user accounts.
2.3 Security:

Encryption:
Utilize ReactJS and SpringBoot to implement encryption protocols for secure data transmission and storage.
Access Controls:
Implement role-based access controls using Spring Security to restrict unauthorized access.
Data Backup and Recovery:
Develop Java functions to perform regular data backup and implement a recovery mechanism.
3. Non-functional Requirements:

3.1 Performance:

The portal should handle a high volume of concurrent users without significant performance degradation, utilizing ReactJS and SpringBoot optimizations.
3.2 Scalability:

Design the system architecture to be scalable using ReactJS and SpringBoot capabilities.
3.3 Usability:

Ensure a user-friendly interface using HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap 5, and ReactJS, with considerations for accessibility.
3.4 Reliability:

Develop a reliable system using ReactJS and SpringBoot with minimal downtime for maintenance and updates.
3.5 Compatibility:

Ensure compatibility with major web browsers and devices using HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap 5, and ReactJS.
3.6 Compliance:

Ensure compliance with data protection laws and regulations using secure back-end technologies.
4. Technical Requirements:

Develop the front-end using HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap 5, and ReactJS.
Implement the back-end using Java, SpringBoot, Hibernate, JPA, and connect to a MySQL database.
5. Constraints:

Limited budget for development and maintenance.
Integration challenges with existing government databases and systems.
Compliance with existing legal and regulatory frameworks.
6. Assumptions and Dependencies:

Assumption that users have basic internet access and digital literacy.
Dependencies on third-party services for security protocols and data analytics tools.

This Software Requirement Specification document outlines the technology stack and requirements for both front-end and back-end components of the Online Grievance
Redressal Portal, incorporating HTML5, CSS3, JS, BootStrap 5, ReactJS, Java, SpringBoot, Hibernate, JPA, and MySQL. It serves as a guide for the development team and
will be subject to updates as the project progresses
